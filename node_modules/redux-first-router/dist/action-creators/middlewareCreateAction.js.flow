// REACT NATIVE FEATURE:
// emulate npm `history` package and `historyCreateAction`  so that actions
// and state indicate the user went back or forward. The idea is if you are
// going back or forward to a route you were just at, apps can determine
// from `state.location.kind === 'back|next'` and `action.kind` that things like
// scroll position should be restored.
// NOTE: for testability, history is also returned to make this a pure function
